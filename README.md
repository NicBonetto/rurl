# rurl
Fast URL parser written for JavaScript with ♥ from Rust.

## Motivation
I love JavaScript, but it is not well-suited for every task. I created this project to aid JS developers who noticed performance issues because their CPU was being eaten by costly URL tasks. This URL library, written in Rust, compiles down to WebAssembly and runs alongside your existing JS code as an NPM package. Enjoy ✨
